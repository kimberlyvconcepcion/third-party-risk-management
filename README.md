# third-party-risk-management
Cybersecurity GRC project focused on supplier risk assessment and ISO 27001 alignment

## Overview
This project documents a cybersecurity third-party risk assessment framework developed during my internship at Hilti Asia IT Services.

- Identified high-risk suppliers for mitigation

## Tools Used
- Alyne GRC Platform 
- Excel / Pivot Tables
- ISO 27001

## Outcome
- Reduced assessment time by 70%
- Improved risk scoring accuracy
- Enabled prioritization of critical suppliers

## What I Learned
